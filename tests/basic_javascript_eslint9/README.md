Test project used as an integration test for safety-web.

This JavaScript project is set up with ESLint 9. It uses the `EXPERIMENTAL_useProjectService` which uses the TS language server to process JavaScript code with an inferred tsconfig (similar to what VSCode does). See https://typescript-eslint.io/packages/parser/#experimental_useprojectservice.
